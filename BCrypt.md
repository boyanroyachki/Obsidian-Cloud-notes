BCrypt is a popular password hashing function widely recommended for securing passwords. It is designed to be slow, intentionally making brute-force attacks more difficult by requiring significant computational time for each password hash attempt.

### Key Features of BCrypt:

1. **One-Way Hashing**: BCrypt hashes passwords using a one-way hashing function, making it computationally infeasible to reverse the hash to the original password【6†source】【8†source】.
  
2. **Salting**: Each password hash in BCrypt includes a unique salt. This means even if two users have the same password, their hashes will differ. This protects against rainbow table attacks【10†source】.

3. **Cost Factor**: BCrypt uses a configurable cost factor, which determines the number of iterations the hashing function performs. A higher cost factor increases the time required to generate the hash, thereby increasing the difficulty for attackers to crack it using brute force methods. The default cost factor has been increased over time to counteract advances in hardware capabilities【9†source】【7†source】.

4. **Automatic Salting**: The salt is embedded in the hash output, making it unnecessary to store or manage salts separately. This simplifies implementation and enhances security【10†source】.

### BCrypt vs. Other Algorithms:

- **PBKDF2**: While also used for password hashing, PBKDF2 can be more efficiently accelerated with GPUs, making it somewhat less resistant to brute-force attacks compared to BCrypt【7†source】.
- **Argon2**: Argon2 is newer and considered more secure by some experts, offering better resistance to side-channel attacks and more flexibility. However, BCrypt remains widely trusted and used【7†source】【9†source】.

### Recommendations for Using BCrypt:

- **Increase Rounds**: To keep up with increasing computational power, it is recommended to periodically increase the cost factor (number of rounds). Laravel, for example, has increased its default rounds from 10 to 12 in recent updates【9†source】.
- **Implementation**: BCrypt is implemented in various programming languages and platforms, including Python, PHP, and Node.js, making it versatile for different development environments【6†source】【10†source】.

BCrypt remains a robust and reliable choice for password hashing, offering significant security features that help protect against common attack vectors. For those implementing password security in applications, ensuring the use of a sufficient cost factor and staying updated with best practices is crucial.
