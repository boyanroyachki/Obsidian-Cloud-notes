### Spring Data REST Overview

**Spring Data REST** is part of the Spring Data project family and provides an easy way to build hypermedia-driven RESTful web services on top of Spring Data repositories. It automatically exports your Spring Data repositories as RESTful endpoints, providing a powerful and flexible mechanism to interact with your data over HTTP【15†source】【16†source】.

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Exposure of Repositories**:
   - Spring Data REST automatically creates REST endpoints for your Spring Data repositories. For example, a `PersonRepository` interface will have endpoints for CRUD operations on `Person` entities.
   ```java
   @RepositoryRestResource
   public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {
       List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);
       @RestResource(path = "byFirstname")
       List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
   }
   ```

2. **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**:
   - Utilizes HAL (Hypertext Application Language) to provide a consistent and discoverable API. HAL Explorer can be used to browse the API easily.

3. **Pagination and Sorting**:
   - Supports pagination and sorting out of the box, making it easy to handle large datasets efficiently.
   ```java
   Page<Person> findByLastname(String lastname, Pageable pageable);
   ```

4. **Query Method Exporting**:
   - Custom queries can be exposed as dedicated search resources. These can be defined using Spring Data JPA query methods and annotated with `@RestResource`.
   ```java
   @RestResource(path = "byFirstname")
   List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(@Param("firstname") String firstname);
   ```

5. **Conditional Requests**:
   - Supports conditional operations using HTTP headers, such as `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since`, to manage cache and optimize network traffic.

6. **Event Hooks**:
   - Allows developers to hook into the lifecycle events of RESTful operations, such as `BeforeCreateEvent` or `AfterDeleteEvent`, providing opportunities for custom behavior.

7. **Projections and Excerpts**:
   - Enables defining different views for your data to cater to various client requirements using projections.

8. **Customizing Paths and Properties**:
   - Base paths and other properties can be customized easily. For instance, changing the base URI in a Spring Boot application:
   - 
```properties
   spring.data.rest.basePath=/api
```
   
   
   Or via Java configuration:
   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class CustomizedRestMvcConfiguration extends RepositoryRestConfigurerAdapter {
       @Override
       public void configureRepositoryRestConfiguration(RepositoryRestConfiguration config, CorsRegistry cors) {
           config.setBasePath("/api");
       }
   }
   ```

### Getting Started

**Dependencies**:
Include the following Maven dependency in your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-data-rest-webmvc</artifactId>
   <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
```

**Configuration**:
Use the `@RepositoryRestResource` annotation to mark your repository interfaces and optionally customize the endpoints:
```java
@CrossOrigin
@RepositoryRestResource(path = "people")
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {
   List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);
   @RestResource(path = "byFirstname")
   List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
}
```

You can start your Spring Data REST application as either a Spring Boot app or configure it as a traditional Spring MVC application. The REST API will be available at the endpoints derived from your repository interfaces.
